The stepwise update and forecast process involves iteratively fitting an ARIMA model to the training data, forecasting a small batch of future values, and updating the model with actual observed values from the test set. At each iteration, a batch of test data is selected, and the ARIMA model is trained on the current training dataset (current_train). The model then forecasts the next batch_size values, which are stored in the forecasts list. The training data is updated by appending the observed test values from the current batch, enabling the model to incorporate the latest real-world data for improved future predictions. The true observed values are stored for evaluation, ensuring accuracy can be assessed, such as by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
